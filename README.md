# Containerization--Deployment-of-Wisecow-
- Project Overview
This project demonstrates the containerisation, deployment, and automation (CI/CD) of the Wisecow Application — a simple bash-based web server that displays random quotes using the fortune and cowsay commands.
The app is Dockerized, deployed on Kubernetes, and integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- Objectives
1. Containerize the Wisecow application using Docker
2. Deploy it to a Kubernetes environment (Minikube / Kind / Killercoda)
3. Automate the build & push process using GitHub Actions
4. Enable secure & accessible service exposure (port-based access)
